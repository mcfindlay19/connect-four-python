# connect-four-python
This is just a fun little project I was working on to get familiar with Python. I wanted a physical representation of the game, in-line, so I used emojis.
I used alpha-beta pruning for the AI, and wrote my own algorithm for win checking. I would like to revisit this at some point to make this faster and the AI more robust. Connect 4 is a solved game and I would like my AI to be able to do this.
